# Quantitative Due Diligence


The full service name is: quantitative investigation carried out with due diligence. 
The quantitative due diligence, or quantitative audit, is the voluntary and independent processes performed 
to ascertain how well a company, usually a startup, is doing with respect to quantitative (finance) matters.
The quantitative due diligence is typically requested

- By a venture capitalist to better gauge the value of a startup before a round of investment 
- By a startup on itself, to understand their weaknesses or to show their present/future value to current or potential investors. 
- By an established crypto company, to prove to their clients and investors that the company is properly dealing with their quantitative matters

In all cases the due diligence will provide a new level of transparency and confidence to the company quantitative functions.


### What are the main areas of the assessment?

The due diligence process for all companies can be divided into the following distinct areas

- Review of the quantitative models currently used by the company
- Revision of the data pipeline that transforms the raw input data into the model outputs. This includes the handling of data cleaning and outlier detection, the pre-processing phase, the model training and its evaluation
- Gauge the processes of creating/deploying existing or new models from the prototype stage to the production environment
- Consider what is the impact of the market volatility on the revenue/performance of the company. For example the company could do well in a bull market but not in a bear market, or the other way around
- Meet the research-and-development team, in order to identify if and what are the missing human resources, how to improve the team dynamics, or what kind of quantitative training may benefit the team
- Interview new high-level candidates to be hired for key quantitative roles


### What are the extra steps for web3/crypto companies?

For crypto companies the due diligence is also extended to investigate tokens and/or smart contracts

- Review the tokenomics, i.e. the interaction between the company token and the blockchain smart contracts, the market and the token holders
- Advise on which blockchains, on both layers 1 and 2, the token should be launched, mirrored or proxied
- Help to optimize the time-to-market of token operations such as direct token sales, auctions and so on
- Review and investigate if the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can add value to the company/users/investors
- When possible, provide a quick quantitative evaluation of the current and expected token value
- Help the team to find/improve the token utility, in order to increase its value 
- Audit the most important smart contracts from the quantitative point of view, in order to understand and estimate what are the potential risks and upside. (Note that this is not the same as a security audit)
- Review the company token offering on both centralized and decentralized exchanges
- Consider new ways of improving the tokenomics, such as providing staking or quoting on a automated-market maker (in which case which one to choose)
- Evaluate what is the impact of using oracles (being them implicit or explicit) on the smart contracts 
- Assess what are the quantitative vulnerabilities, such as an arbitrage attack where an adversary can slowly empty a smart contract from its tokens. (Note that these attacks are usually not detected by a security audit)
- Investigate on what are the possible catastrophic scenarios that could abruptly shink the company value (for example Luna/UST had many vulnerabilities) and estimate their probability


### What are the areas of proposed improvement?

- Evaluate if additional mathematical/statistical methods can be useful to the company
- Assess if the employed machine-learning/artificial-intelligence techniques are sufficient or if they can be improved, both in terms of cost, speed, and accuracy
- Suggest if/how the current research/development workflow can be streamlined to increase efficiency 
- Possibly consider what type of additional human resources could increase the company value
- Possibly, suggest ways to hedge the impact of market volatility on the company value


### What is not part of the process?

To avoid confusion, the quantitative due diligence process does not perform the following tasks:

- Financial audit.
- Management audit.
- A full security audit


### What are the documents that are obtained from the due diligence?

The results of the quantitative due diligence are two documents, one private to the 
people that requested it and another public. 

The private report typically contains the full audit details:

- A detailed discussion of each of the above points
- The critical issues that need to be solved urgently
- The important issues that are not urgent, however that need full attention
- Other suggestions that can increase the company value

The public report is typically shorter and is usually a summary of the findings, without going into the details.
