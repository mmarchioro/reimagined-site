Model validation involves the processes and activities that verify models are performing as intended, 
and should be a core element of model risk management. 
For instance, the Basel Committee’s minimum standards for internal ratings-based institutions require a regular cycle of model validation that includes 

- monitoring of model performance and stability 
- review of model relationships
- and testing of model outputs against outcomes

### Regulatory standards

Model validation is regulated in many bank activities because it has shown to be an excellent instrument in lowering financial and credit risks.
Companies in the Web3 world are not regulated yet, however we think that self regulation should be used as to increase public and  investor confidence in a company.

The highest standard for model validation include:

- A **robust validation framework**: A strong robust model framework should set out key policies, processes, roles and responsibilities covering model validation activities.
- A **robust back testing framework**: it is critical to establish robust back testing framework in order to determine model’s ability to capture risk exposure. For instance, as indicated above CCR models characterize by their complexity require extra efforts in defining a sound and comprehensive back testing framework.
- An **independent model validation**: those performing model validation must be able to carry out effective, unbiased assessments (i.e. demonstrate independence of model validation activities from model development ones). For example the ECB Guide also sets out expectations for third party model validation.
- A **frequent model validation**: as mentioned, back-testing of models’ expected and actual outputs should take place at least once in a while. However, the frequency of model validation may vary depending on the nature and complexity of the model.
- An **initial and periodic validation**: model validation should not only occur before a model’s deployment, but also periodically during its use and whenever it is altered or amended.
- The **reporting of validation outcomes**: for model validation to be effective, outcomes and severity assessments must be reported to appropriate internal bodies - and be acted upon.
- The **follow-up of validation issues**: model weaknesses identified during validation should be appropriately documented and monitored to resolution, ensuring that follow-up actions are executed in a timely manner.

These are very stringent targets and might not implemented all at once. 
In any case, it is proven that the validation process itself brings a lot of benefits to any company.
