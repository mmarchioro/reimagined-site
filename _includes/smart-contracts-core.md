Smart contracts are software transaction protocols that can only be executed if are validated by the blockchain. They
can perform a number of different functions, however, typically they act on the blockchain ledger, either on a given token or 
on some other state. Presently, smart contracts are serving a wide range of use cases such as supply chain management, ICOs, and electoral voting. 

The problem with smart contracts, regardless of the name, is that they are not *smart*. They are just bits of code that run 
on top of the blockchain state. They only execute the code that was written for them, not was intended for them.


## Security audit

#### If it's just code, why don't I just take a random developer to write them?

It is true that smart contracts are just lines of code, however they are written in the immutability *stone* that is the blockchain.
The main difference with respect to the standard programming are:

- Smart contracts may have the capacity to transfer large amount of tokens/coins/assets. If they are not well written some of the assets may be lost forever
- It is in general not possible, or not advisable, to update the *software* inside a smart contract
- The behaviour of smart contracts on the developer blockchain, or even a testnet, might be very different from the action on the main-net blockchain
- For blockchain that fork (Algorand is not one of them), the smart contract might behave differently on the two forks


## Security audit

The audit process for a smart contract focuses on scrutiny of the code used for underwriting the terms and conditions in the smart contract itslef. With the help of such an audit, smart contract developers could easily identify the vulnerabilities and bugs before the deployment of smart contracts. 

The audit usually tackles 

- Better optimization of the code
- Improved performance of smart contracts
- Enhanced security of wallets
- Security against hacking attacks

Generally, third-party entities carry out smart contract audits to ensure a thorough review of the code. On the other hand, enterprises can choose professional, smart contract auditors for carrying out the audit process. 

It is quite important to test the code thoroughly before deploying the smart contract. Why? Once you write the smart contract to the blockchain, it is impossible to change the code. Deploying smart contracts without proper audits could result in untoward circumstances such as discrepancies in the desired performance of the contract. At the same time, inadequate audit processes could also land you up with risks such as loss of personal data or data theft. 

## Smart contract design

Security is one of the formidable concerns for smart contract implementation in present times. The concerns of inefficiency, security issues, and misbehavior could lead to extremely high additional costs in implementing smart contracts on a blockchain network.

Enterprises are troubled regarding smart contract implementation, considering its irreversible nature. Furthermore, you also have the risk of losing the whole contract and associated assets due to security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Therefore, the smart contract audit becomes an important requirement in present times for the following reasons.
