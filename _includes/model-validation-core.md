### What is model validation?

Model validation is the process of determining whether the model accurately represents the expected behavior of system. 
Model validity should be evaluated both operationally, i.e., by determining if model output agrees with observed data, and conceptually, i.e., by determining whether the theory and assumptions underlying the model are justifiable. 
Models can be validated by comparing output to independent field or experimental data sets that align with the simulated scenario. 


### What type of validations are performed at Quant Island?


At Quant Island we perform the following types of model validation:

- Traditional Quantitative models, e.g. based on time-series or stochastic-process analysis
- Machine-Learing based models, where the output is obtained by processing and training the input data
- Smart-contract models, such as *automated-market-makers*, where the interaction with a blockchain represents the main model task

### Why is validation important?

Ultimately, model validation strengthens support for the model and the reliability of its outputs. 
Building a useful simulation requires the construction of a model that is a reasonably accurate representation of the financial phenomenon under consideration. 
Although no model can be “proven correct,” validation is about testing the reliability and plausibility of model performance. 
Due to the dynamic nature of natural systems, model validation should be a perpetually occurring process, especially when new data become available from the physical system.
