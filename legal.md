Use all trading strategies and charts at your own risk. Any content on this website should not be relied upon as advice, or construed as providing recommendations of any kind. It is your responsibility to confirm and decide which trades to make or which smart contracts to use. Trade only with risk capital; that is, trade with money, tokens, and crypto-currencies that, if lost, will not adversely impact your lifestyle and your ability to meet your financial obligations. Past results are no indication of future performance. In no event should the content of this website be construed as an express or implied promise or guarantee. The authors of this website are not responsible for losses incurred as a result of using any of our charts or trading strategies. Loss-limiting strategies such as stop loss orders may not be effective because market conditions or technological issues may make it impossible to execute such orders. Likewise, strategies using combinations of options and/or futures positions such as “spread” or “straddle” trades may be just as risky as simple long and short positions.

No guarantee of any kind is implied, or possible, where projections of future conditions are attempted. None of the content published on this website constitutes a recommendation that any particular token, portfolio of tokens, smart contract, transaction, or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person.
