### Is Algorand the better blockchain?

At Quant Island we think so and we are not afraid to saying it.

Our experience with Algorand goes back to December 2018, when [Silvio Micali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvio-micali-26bb37152/)
and [Naveed Ihsanullah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naveedihsanullah/) came to Singapore to introduce the ideas behind the 
Algorand blockchain.
Since then we followed the evolution of Algorand from the beginning to the present days.
For example, we partecipated to the deployment of the first testnet in April 2019, 
for which we possesed a genesis block!

**What we like about Algorand**

- It doesn't use much energy for the consensus mechanism. [It is actuall carbon neutral!](https://algorand.foundation/news/carbon-neutral)
- Transactions are final. Meaning that you don't need to wait for an unknown amout of time after submissions
- The smart-contract language, namely TEAL, is human readable. (However is not that easy to read!)
- Fungible and non-fungible tokens can be defined by anybody on layer-1
- It is based on a solid cryptographic foundation (and we wouldn't expect anything less from Silvio)
- it is not *going to the moon*, as the [Algorand foundation](https://algorand.foundation) is more interested in ecostystem than having a high-priced token 

### How Quant Island help me with Algorand

While Algorand is a great blockchain for people that are well versed in the world of cryptography, it might not be straightforward 
for the traditional developer toi understand.
